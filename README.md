Our Aim of this project is to create virtual shops that includes delivery to customers
Our motive of this idea is most of e commerce websites have no delivery services.
The shops will have number of followers and rating that helps users to choose among the best.
We planned to implement these software by Django (Backend) and react js (Frontend)
The technical problem that might hinder our implementation is The broad idea we thought. Its complicated to complete this kind of tasks as a beginner developer but with some experience we believe we can overcome these problems 
The page we planned for this website are:
 	Homepage: which briefly introduces customers to the page and guides them to the destination they are planning to go
 	Customer page: The customer sees this page and first see shops and can get into the shops and can choose any product from that shop ,he rates the shop, rate products ,order products with delivery
 	Seller page: The seller first register to be seller and he sees a page with form to add shops and to add product for each shops, see notifications when orders come 
 	Register: to register sellers
 	Order page:  customer orders products and the order forms are available here
 	Item Page: image of the item with full description ,rating of it
